                    Hi! I am Adam Tsai
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying to be a software developer in Los Angeles, California
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find out more about me on this website!

                    About me
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I have always wanted to make a fully functional website/application myself and I 
                    am looking to make this dream a reality. The more I learn about software engineering, 
                    the more passionate I become. I hope throughout this program, I will get an opportunity 
                    to build a website with fellow students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Aside from my goals, I also have the following hobbies:
